# Contributing to the project

## Is that possible?
Actually you can!

## What's the matter?
If the goals of this project aren't clear yet, make sure to have read the <a href=goals>goals</a> first.

## Why
Finding the meaning of unknown S-RAM pieces is time-consuming. That's why it needs help from community.
Your help would save much time in not doing something twice what someone else already did.

The more people contribute, the earlier and better the results.

But after all this is a free time project and developing tools or finding all offset meanings needs hundreds of hours.

## How to contribute
There are a view different ways of contributing to the project

#### Exploring S-RAM data
First of all, it's not difficult to do that. There is a convenient tool which does the nasty work of comparison for you, meaning there is no need to use a hex-editor. Promised ;-)

If you're not **too** scared of bits and bytes, you could explore the unknown areas by yourself. Check out <a href=exploring>here</a> how it works.

However, if bits and bytes aren't your thing, that's fine, too. You can contribute in different ways.

#### Alternative 1 : Localizing (translating)
Do you speak a language that this website doesn't currently offer but think you think it should be supported? 
In that case, you could consider a localization in your language. You could open up this project to people who  understand only *your* language.

If you want to do that, Cool! Then click <a href=localizing>here</a>.

#### Alternative 2 : Advertising
Tell your friends/audience/followers about this project. 

Make it publicly known so crowd sourcing can start to kick in.

**Thank you!** 😊

Also **many thanks** to <a href=contributors>those</a> who already contributed to this project.
